		<p>More than one analysis is shown for wells UE-25b#1, USW H-1, USW VH-1, and
UE-29a#2. The multiple analyses permit a comparison of water compositions as
a function of volume of water pumped. The sample obtained on July 20, 1982,
from UE-25b#1 was collected after 28 days of pumping of an interval 863 to
875 m below the land surface (Daniels and others, 1982). This interval was
isolated using inflatable packers. Well USW H-1 was first sampled on
October 20, 1980, after drilling to a depth of 687 m; the hole then was cased
and tack cemented from 677 to 687 m, deepened to 1,829 m, and a water sample</p>
		<p>was obtained on December 8, 1980, while pumping the interval from 687 to
1,829 m.</p>
		<p>Plots of relative cation and anion concentrations in Yucca Mountain
ground water (fig. 7) indicate that sodium and bicarbonate ions are the
predominant cation and anion. However, ground water in the Yucca Mountain
area is not chemically homogeneous (figs. 8 and 9). The chemical composition
of ground water from well UE-29a#2 is characterized by low concentrations of
sodium, potassium, bicarbonate, and fluoride and a high concentration of
chloride relative to the compositions of other ground water in the Yucca
Mountain area. Ground water from well UE-29a#2 is isotopically light with
respect to 8'80 (det oxygen-18) and 8D (del deuterium); its uncorrected *4C
(carbon-14) age is the youngest of all ground water in the area (fig. 10).
Ground water from well J-12 and well J-13 have low concentrations of sodium
and high concentrations of potassium, magnesium, calcium, and fluoride (figs.
8 and 9). These ground-water samples are isotopically heavy with respect to
8:80, 8D, and 8*°C (del carbon-13); the uncorrected *4C ages of these samples
are relatively young (fig. 10). Ground water from wells USW H-4 and USW H-6
is characterized by low concentrations of sodium, bicarbonate, sulfate, and
fluoride (figs. 8 and 9); ground water from these wells is isotopically light
with respect to 8*°C and 8D. The uncorrected **C age of ground water from
well USW H-4 is the oldest of all ground water from the Yucca Mountain area.
Ground water from well USW VH-1 has low concentrations of sodium, magnesium,
bicarbonate, sulfate, chloride, and fluoride; the water is isotopically light
with respect to 8'80 and 8D, and it has the second oldest uncorrected **C age.</p>
		<p>FLOW SURVEYS</p>
		<p>Flow surveys were conducted in those wells near the periphery of the
Yucca Mountain exploratory block. Results of these surveys indicate that
fluid production usually is from a few discrete permeable intervals (figs. 4
to 6). Exceptions to this generalization are evident in the flow-survey data
for well USW H-4 (fig. 5A) and well USW H-5 (fig. 6A). In well USW H-4, the
majority of fluid production came from numerous zones throughout the upper
one-half of the saturated interval penetrated by the borehole. In well
USW H-5, fluid production in the upper one-half of the Bullfrog Member of the
Crater Flat Tuff of Tertiary age also was associated with numerous zones.
Borehole flow-survey data also indicate that for well UE-29a#2 production
principally was from rhyolitic lavas of the Tuffaceous beds of Calico Hills of
Tertiary age (R. K. Waddell, U.S. Geological Survey, written commun., 1983).
Water injection tests using packers indicate that most of the production in
wells J-12 and J-13 comes from the Topopah Spring Member of the Paintbrush
Tuff of Tertiary age (Young, 1972; William Thordarson, U.S. Geological Survey,</p>
